-------------------

ZenPapers is a minimalistic theme utilizing modern flat design elements. It provides maximum above the fold visibility with a widescreen focus, giving best user retention with the elements in the initial view-port. Anything related to general navigation is seen immediately at the top, while user related navigation elements are below any viewed content but immediately visible. 

The code base is simple and clean. 3,244 lines spread across 28 files. The design is built to be in line with oncoming HTML5 standards and to maintain maximum compatibility with all Zenphoto plugins (a perfect replacement for anyone with an aging or unsupported theme). 

ZenPapers currently implements:

1) Wide thumbnails with a sub-album and image count where any album thumbnail is called.

2) Modules for image statistics, image display, and gallery description at the bottom of the index.

3) Previous/Next overlays for the image.php page, as well as thumbnail views of what the previous/next image is.

4) Top Mounted navigation, clearly differentiated from the content.

5) Maximum Flexibility, all theme options are editable from the backend, meaning flexible CSS and no hard coding so no headaches or incompatibility issues that result from them.
